gene.enh.desc
}
\description{
A data frame with gene-level descriptions of enhancer properties using enhancers.dnase_thurman.0. Used in the adjustment of proximity test to enhancers.
\describe{
    \item{gene_id}{The Entrez ID for the a gene}
    \item{avg_denh_emp}{The empirical average distance to an enhancer from 90 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets. This is used as the adjustment.}
    \item{num_enh}{The number of enhancers assigned to the gene, defined by closest gene TSS}
    \item{avgdenh}{The theoretical average distance to an enhancer assuming every base pair on the genome is equally likely to have a peak binding.}
